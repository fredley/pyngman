###An optimal hangman-guessing python script, by Tom Medley

##Usage

1. Get a [Dictionary](http://en-gb.pyxidium.co.uk/dictionary/OOo.php)
2. Run `python pyngman.py -init path-to-dict.zip`
3. Run `python pyngman.py -state ..e..y estry`, where ..e..y is the state of the
game, and estry are the letters you've already used. pyngman will tell you what 
your optimal next move is.

##Dictionaries

pyngman is designed to work with a `.zip` dictionary file, such as the ones
available at [Pyxidium](http://en-gb.pyxidium.co.uk/dictionary/OOo.php) for
Open Office. I have tested the script with their en-GB dictionary.

The script will parse the dictionary into a complete list of words, removing 
words deemed 'invalid' for hangman, such as those containing apostrophes or 
dashes.
